# Header
This is a Fusion landing page that contains different sections with different designs, the main language used on the page was css especially the flex display.

## Things i learnt on the project
    it was my first time thinking about not just building the project, but building the project to be compatible with many different devices, my depth of knowledge in css was also increased while i was working on the project, i tried so many css styles that i had not tried before and learnt how to use the flex display element, it was also the most laborious project i have worked on so far, but ultimately, i believe the time invested into this project was worth it as it enabled me to become even better  at building web pages.
